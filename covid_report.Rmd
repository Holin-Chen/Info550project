The plot of cumulative COVID-19 cases in the US by state
```{r, figure}
knitr::include_graphics("myPlot.png")
```


## Explore data and create table

Now I want to know the case fatality rate (CFR) by calculating deaths divided by cases in each state. I create this new variable. Then I want to see which state or area have the maximum, median, and minimum cases among the US. I extract the rows of this data include the latest case and death counts, and CFR. Finally I put them into a table.
```{r table}
#create the new data with the latest case and death counts, and CFR
source("clean_data.R")
s <- a %>% 
  group_by(state) %>%
  summarise(latest_cases = max(cases, na.rm=T),
            latest_deaths = max(deaths, na.rm=T),
            latest_CFR = paste0(round(latest_deaths*100/latest_cases, digits=2),'%'))

#Put the 3 rows into a table
summary_table <- 
  s[c(which.max(s$latest_cases),
      which(s$latest_cases==median(s$latest_cases)),
      which.min(s$latest_cases)), ]

summary_table$cases_level <- c('max cases','median cases','min cases')
summary_table <- summary_table[,c(1,5,2:4)]

knitr::kable(summary_table, row.names(c('max cases','median cases','min cases')),align = 'c')
```
`r s$state[which.max(s$latest_cases)]` has the most cumulative cases with `r max(s$latest_cases)` cases so far. It's case fatality rate is `r s$latest_CFR[which.max(s$latest_cases)]`. `r s$state[which.min(s$latest_cases)]` has the least cumulative cases with `r min(s$latest_cases)` cases so far. It's case fatality rate is `r s$latest_CFR[which.min(s$latest_cases)]`.

<!--
I will use the data from this github respository for my final project in this class, which is inconsistent with what I said in homework 1 as my initial thought, casue my thesis progress is kinda slow now and I decide to change my idea to use some public data instead. Also I think using data direclty in github should make my work more reproducible!
